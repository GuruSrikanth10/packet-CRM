"""Phase 7 of DLT_PLAN.md -- per-fingerprint group records.

A *group* is the durable record for one failure mode: how often it has been
seen, when it started, which cases belong to it, and the recommendation (if
any) an earlier investigation produced for it.

At ~2,000 messages/day with tens of distinct fingerprints, the group is what
turns a per-message cost into a per-*bug* cost. It is also the unit an operator
actually wants to read: "this bug has hit 431 packets since Tuesday" is a more
useful sentence than 431 individual casebooks.

`members` is capped. An uncapped list on a fingerprint seeing 400 hits/day
would grow without bound; `occurrence_count` keeps counting past the cap.

**Updates go through `CasebookStorage.update_json`, not load-then-save.** Both
mutations here are read-modify-write on a counter, and the DLT analysis role
is meant to scale out. This used to be guarded by a `filelock` under
`LOCAL_CHECKPOINTS_DIR` -- which coordinates processes on a shared filesystem
and does nothing at all for two pods on different nodes, while the group
records themselves were in S3. So on precisely the deployment the lock was
written for, every increment was a lost-update race and two pods analysing one
novel fingerprint could each write a different `recommendation`,
last-writer-wins. `update_json` puts the atomicity in the backend that can
actually provide it: a held lock locally, a conditional write on S3.
