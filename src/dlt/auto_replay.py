"""Extension to DLT_PLAN.md Phase 8 -- automatic replay on a high-confidence
redrive finding.

DLT_PLAN.md's own non-goals (section 2) rule out remediation for v1: "No
remediation. No replay, no redrive, no writes to any upstream service." This
module is the deliberate, narrow exception to that, added because a real
mechanism exists downstream (a Temporal remediation flow that repairs the DB
inconsistency behind codes like INDEX_MASTER_DATA_NOT_FOUND) that this system
had no way to know about. It stays off by default
(DLT_AUTO_REPLAY_ENABLED=false), and every condition that gates it is named so
a skipped replay is auditable, not silent.

**Two independent switches, not one.** `DLT_AUTO_REPLAY_ENABLED` decides
whether the DLT lane may call `queue_for_replay` at all. Once called, that
tool's own `ENABLE_AUTO_REPLAY` switch (unchanged, shared with the rejection
flow) decides what happens next: `true` posts straight to the OIS replay
endpoint, `false` -- the safer default -- appends to `pending_replays.jsonl`
for a human to approve via `approve_replays.py`. Turning DLT_AUTO_REPLAY_ENABLED
on with ENABLE_AUTO_REPLAY left off means "let the DLT lane nominate packets
for replay, but still make a human press the button" -- the sensible default
posture, and worth reaching for before ever turning both on together.

**Why REDRIVE_AFTER_RECOVERY, and not DATA_FIX_REQUIRED.** DATA_FIX_REQUIRED
is Class A's typical action -- the code says a row is missing, and nothing
about the packet or the environment has changed just because time passed.
Replaying it reproduces the identical dead letter. REDRIVE_AFTER_RECOVERY is
different: DltSynthesisAgent.md instructs the model to choose it specifically
for "a transient or infrastructure fault; replay once the dependency is
healthy" -- which is exactly the shape of a mis-cast finding, where
corroboration showed the declared business exception wasn't the real story and
the logs pointed at something transient instead. That is also the only
finding shape a confidence-gated check can act on in the first place --
canned.py never attaches a confidence to a Class C finding ("no model
produced this"), so a canned redrive recommendation can never clear a
confidence threshold and never triggers this path. Only an LLM-synthesised (or
group-reused) REDRIVE_AFTER_RECOVERY carries a real number to threshold
against.

**Why the default confidence threshold sits at 0.55, not higher.** The only
realistic route to a non-None-confidence REDRIVE_AFTER_RECOVERY is a
CONTRADICTED corroboration verdict (a CORROBORATED one means the business
exception really did happen, which argues against "replay will fix it"), and
CONTRADICTED is capped at DEFAULT_CONTRADICTED_CEILING (0.6) in
dlt_synthesis.py. A threshold at or above that ceiling would make this feature
permanently inert -- no finding could ever clear it. 0.55 sits just under the
ceiling, so a well-evidenced mis-cast conclusion can actually pass while a
weak one still cannot.

**What is still a guess.** `id`/`idType`/`category`/`priority`/`fromSedaStart`
describe the rejection flow's contract with a live OIS endpoint
(OIS_FEIGN_BASE_URL). The rejection flow always passes `id = eventId`; a DLT
case has no eventId, only `ref_id` -- the same correlation id used for log
matching. Whether OIS's replay API accepts a bare refId, and what idType/
category/priority values it expects for a DLT-originated redrive, has not been
confirmed against the real endpoint. Every one of these is therefore
configurable (see .env.example) rather than hardcoded, so a wrong guess is a
config change, not a code change -- and DLT_AUTO_REPLAY_ENABLED stays off
until an operator has actually confirmed them.
