"""
Pod log retrieval (KUBERNETES_LOGS_PLAN.md 5.3 - 5.4).

Reads logs for each discovered (pod, container) target, streaming rather than
buffering, and handles in-place container restarts.

Two mandatory call parameters, both easy to omit and expensive to get wrong:

  timestamps=True
      Makes the kubelet prefix every line with an RFC3339Nano timestamp,
      giving a reliable ordering key even when the application's own log
      format is unparseable. Without it, cross-pod merging is guesswork.

  _preload_content=False
      All filtering is client-side (the API has no server-side grep), so a
      multi-hundred-megabyte log must be streamed and filtered line by line.
      Buffering 20 pods x 10MB is 200MB resident in a process that is also
      running the LangGraph agents.
