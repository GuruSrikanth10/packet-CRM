"""
Ordered source chain with fallback (KUBERNETES_LOGS_PLAN.md 4.4).

`LOG_SOURCE` is an ordered, comma-separated chain. A single value means a
single source; several mean fallback in order:

    elastic               today's behaviour (the default)
    kubernetes            Kubernetes only
    kubernetes,elastic    try Kubernetes, fall back to Elasticsearch
    elastic,kubernetes    the reverse

Fallback triggers when a source fails (`ok=False`) OR returns no records --
both mean "we did not get logs here", which is the operative condition.

Sources are never merged or de-duplicated: one wins per fetch. Kubernetes
supplements Elasticsearch rather than combining with it, and a dedup bug
across sources with different clock sources would silently delete evidence,
which is precisely the failure this whole project exists to eliminate.
