"""
The Synthesis output contract (ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md 4.3, 4.4).

`SynthesisAgent.md` specifies exact enums for `action` and `resident_action`,
and nothing validated them: routes.py ran a regex, then json.loads, then fell
back to `{"rejection_description": str(...)}`. A malformed response therefore
produced a casebook with `action: null` that was indistinguishable, downstream,
from a packet the agents genuinely could not classify -- and an LLM returning
"REPLAY_PACKET" instead of "REPLAY" was accepted verbatim.

Parsing lives here, beside the schema, so the orchestrator (which repairs) and
routes.py (which persists) apply exactly the same rules.
