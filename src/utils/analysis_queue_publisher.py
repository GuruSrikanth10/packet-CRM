"""
Producer for the analysis queue (the fetch/analyze consumer split).

POST /fetch-logs publishes the original payload here once its logs are
fetched and persisted; the slow consumer subscribes to this topic and
forwards each message to POST /analyze-rejection. Mirrors dlq_publisher.py's
shape (cached producer, `acks="all"` so the last line of defence for handing
work to the slow consumer isn't a leader-only ack), but publishes the payload
unwrapped -- there is no error to envelope here, unlike a DLQ message.
