"""Process supervisor for the Packet-CRM ecosystem.

Spawns the API and both Kafka consumers -- fast_consumer.py (rejections ->
POST /fetch-logs) and slow_consumer.py (the analysis queue -> POST
/analyze-rejection) -- then holds all three open. If any exits, the rest are
terminated rather than left running half a system: a consumer with no API
forwards every packet into a connection error, and an API with no consumers
silently stops receiving work (F12). Each consumer sets its own CONSUMER_ROLE
before importing kafkaConsumer.py, so no special per-child environment is
needed here to keep their topics, heartbeat files, and health ports apart.
