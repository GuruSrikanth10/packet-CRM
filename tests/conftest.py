"""Test-suite isolation from the developer's `.env`.

`src/utils/env.py` calls `load_dotenv()` at import time, and every production
module imports it transitively. So without this file, `pytest` inherits
whatever happens to be in `.env` -- and the suite's verdict depends on the
machine it runs on.

That was not hypothetical. A checkout with `LOG_SOURCE=kubernetes`,
`K8S_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=offline` and `K8S_FIXTURE_DIR=...` set locally failed
three tests that passed in CI, because the CI job sets `LOG_SOURCE=elastic`
and nothing else. A developer seeing red tests they cannot attribute learns to
stop reading the suite.

The fixture is session-scoped and autouse, so it runs before any test module
imports production code. It only clears variables that select a *deployment
shape* -- a backend, a source chain, a feature flag. Tunables (timeouts, caps,
thresholds) are left alone: tests that care about those set them explicitly
via monkeypatch, and clearing them here would only mask a missing setenv.
